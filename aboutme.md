subtitle: A Cajun on the run
---

My name is Marshall. I come from the little-known town of Eunice, LA, home to famous Cajun musicians, good Gumbo, and a mean Mardi Gras that rivals even the New Orleans tradition. After high school, I moved to study at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, where I graduated with a degree in Computer Science. After that, I moved again, this time to study at the Paul M. Hebert School of Law at LSU in Baton Rouge, where I'm currently on my way to becoming a lawyer. 

I'm interested in the fields of IP, patents, and technology-related law, with an emphasis on anything that deals with new and developing technologies, including  A.I.
